# Vibrating Heart ðŸ’–

This repository contains a fun and interactive "Vibrating Heart" animation created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project showcases the use of basic web technologies to create an engaging visual effect, perfect for learning or for use in a romantic web project.

## Project Overview

The "Vibrating Heart" is a single-page web application that features a heart shape that vibrates or pulses when hovered over or clicked. This simple yet charming effect is achieved through the combined use of CSS animations and JavaScript for interactivity.

## Features

- **Vibrating Heart Animation:** A heart that vibrates with a smooth animation on hover or click.
- **Responsive Design:** The heart animation scales well across different screen sizes and devices.
- **Customizable Styles:** Easily tweak the heartâ€™s color, size, and vibration speed using CSS.
- **Interactive Effects:** The animation is triggered by user interaction, adding an element of surprise and engagement.
